# weather-data-scraper
This Python script scrapes weather forecast data from the National Weather Service website. Using BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing and requests for HTTP requests, it extracts seven-day forecasts (period names, short descriptions, temperatures) and stores them in a CSV file for analysis or visualization.
